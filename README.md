## What is this all about?

Usually optimization algorithms are compared by running benchmarks on test problems. For the well-known Traveling-Salesperson-Problem (TSP) diverse benchmark sets exist ranging from instances placed purely at random in the Euclidean plane (so-called Random Uniform Euclidean, RUE), placed in cluster structures (see e.g., the related [netgen](https://github.com/jakobbossek/netgen) R package) or stemming from real-world applications (e.g., [TSPlib](https://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/) or [VLSI](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/) instances). 

In the past decade due to advances in machine learning the area of per-instance [Algorithm Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_selection) (AS) gained importance significantly. Here, the primary goal is to build a decision-rule that decides for a certain algorithm from a portfolio of algorithms which will most likely perform best on a given instance. Application of AS to the TSP problem is highly encouraging (see, e.g., [1]). The learning process of the decision rule usually relies on a set of (computationally cheap) characteristics of problem instances, termed *instance features* or simply *features*. Another aspect closely related to AS is the understanding of working principles of algorithms: which features / feature combinations are crucial to determine the performance of a given algorithm or a pair of algorithms? Which feature values or ranges of feature values of an instance at hand pose a hard challenge for an algorithm?
Recent research approaches to answer this interesting question adopt evolutionary algorithms which evolve a population of instances which are particularly hard for a given algorithm with respect to approximation quality [2, 3] or maximizing the performance gap between two competitive solvers [4, 5]. However, the latter approaches stick to simple, straight forward mutation operators which results in instances with severe structural similarity and high visual similarity to RUE instances.

One drawback of the afore-mentioned evolutionary instance generation process is the simplicity of mutation operators. In a nutshell the process is as follows: place n points uniformly at random in the Euclidean plane [0,1]x[0,1] and iteratively move points around by adding Gaussian noise or replacing selected points with new points again placed uniformly at random. Obviously, such basic operations are not able to introduce significant structural diversity and even after thousands of iterations the instance will most likely be similar to the initial solution in particular if n is large.

This package introduces a set of sophisticated, problem tailored mutation operators which allow for the generation of more diverse sets of instances. The proposed mutation operators have a much higher impact on the points than the ones mentioned before. E.g., *explosion mutation* generates an *explosion* within the points cloud leaving a hole where not points are placed at all. In contrast *cluster mutation* selects a random subset of points and generates a circular cluster somewhere in the plane.

## Quickstart

In order to generate an instance we (1) specify a collection of mutation operators and application probabilities and (2) start the generation process.

```r
# add mutation operators one by one
set.seed(1)
collection = init()
collection = addMutator(collection, "doExplosionMutation")
collection = addMutator(collection, "doClusterMutation", pm = 0.2)
collection = addMutator(collection, "doAxisProjectionMutation", pm = 0.3)
collection = addMutator(collection, "doGridMutation", box.min = 0.3, box.max = 0.5)
# define probabilities
collection = setProbabilities(collection, probs = c(0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2))
print(collection)

# generate instance
x = build(n = 1000L, iters = 100L, collection = collection, bound.handling = "uniform")
print(autoplot(x))
```
